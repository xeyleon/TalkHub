# TalkHub
 A message board website that allows users to discuss topics of interest and share ideas and thoughts with one another.
 TalkHub uses Apache as its web server, PHP as its server-side scripting language, and MySQL as its backend database.

## The Database
The MySQL database stores all the data utilized by TalkHub, from user account information to details regarding topics and posts.
The complexity of the database has deliberately been kept minimal, thus it consists of only the following three tables:
*	A users tables that stores all user account information.
* A topics table that stores information about all the topics that have been created.
*	A posts table that stores information about the messages that been posted in every topic.
